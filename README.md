# academia

Various academic projects that I have worked on, all licensed under the APGLv3. Constructive criticism is always welcome and I do intend to keep the projects here alive well after I'm no longer a student!

## C-projects
Academic projects I've worked on while learning and practising C programming. I love all projects equally, but C projects much more than others. These programs should not be expected to resemble production code, they are strictly academic in nature, though I do fully intend on tinkering and improving these as time goes on. I also intend to use my C folder to eventually store embedded system code in addition to (tiny) home and personal automation programs, though these categories aren't limiting by any means.

## Data Science
Academic projects I've worked on while learning and practising data science. Most of them will be Jupyter lab worksheets or little Python scripts that help with data wrangling, though I do intend on growing this out in the future as well!
