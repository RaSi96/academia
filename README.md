# Academia
This repository is dedicated to the various academic projects I have worked on, all licensed under the APGLv3.

## Embedded Systems projects
Simple and relatively elementary course-level projects I've worked on while learning and practising Embedded Systems Engineering. Most of the projects here can be expected to span programming assignments involving microcontrollers from the AVR/ARM/MSP family. They're wicked cool!

## Machine Learning projects
Academic projects I've worked on while sharpening and finessing my ML/AI skills. Most of the projects here can be expected to involve applications of ML/AI techniques and research material to private and/or public datasets. Project files will not include private datasets for obvious reasons, and will most likely consist of Jupyter HTML files or little Python scripts that help with data wrangling.
