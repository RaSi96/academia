# Academia
This repository is dedicated to the various academic projects I have worked on over the years, all licensed under the APGLv3.

## Embedded Systems projects
Simple and relatively elementary projects I've worked on while learning and practising Embedded Systems Engineering. Most of the works here can be expected to span programming assignments involving microcontrollers (which are wicked cool!)

## Machine Learning projects
Academic projects I've worked on while sharpening and finessing my ML/AI skills. Most of the works here can be expected to involve applications of ML/AI techniques and research material to private and/or public datasets. Project files will not include private datasets for obvious reasons, and will most likely consist of Jupyter HTML files or little Python scripts that help with data wrangling.
