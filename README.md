# academia

Various academic projects that I have worked on, all licensed under the APGLv3. Constructive criticism is always welcome and I do intend to keep the projects here alive well after I'm no longer a student!

## C-projects
Simple and relatively elementary course-level projects I've worked on while learning and practising C programming. I love all projects equally, but C projects **much** more than others. This folder will house projects related to embedded systems engineering (and might be reshuffled in the future to better represent topical hierarchy) as well as (tiny) home and personal automation programs, though these categories aren't limiting by any means.

## Data Science
Academic projects I've worked on while learning and practising data science. Most of them should be expected to be Jupyter Lab worksheets or little Python scripts that help with data wrangling, though this folder may very well grow bigger than initially envisaged.
