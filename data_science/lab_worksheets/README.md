This is where I'll be placing my Jupyterlab/Google Colab worksheets. Most of my work is done on an Arch Linux machine except the final run before uploading, which I do on Windows 10 (though I will be changing this pipeline in the very near future.) Apologies in advance if any notebooks fail to load due to their filesizes!

#### IoT_device
Worksheets containing models I've built using [an IoT device dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanbyprinciple/iot-device-identification). This worksheet **is still WiP**: The meat of the worksheet is ready to be served but the potatoes and all-important vegetables are yet to be fully prepared, though they should be done soon(TM). Please note: this worksheet assumes that [this Python module/file](https://github.com/RaSi96/academia/tree/main/data_science/utilities/functions) is within the same folder as itself. I do not and probably will not conjure up the patience to deal with Python's completely ridiculous requirements for imports from another directory, especially within Jupyter environments.
