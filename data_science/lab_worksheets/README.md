This is where I place my Jupyterlab/Google Colab worksheets as PDFs. Almost all of my work is done on either Arch Linux or Fedora.

#### IoT_device
My first "full" model ever built. This uses [the IoT device dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanbyprinciple/iot-device-identification). The `data_manip.py` import references [this Python file](https://github.com/RaSi96/academia/tree/main/data_science/utilities/functions), and assumes it exists within the same directory as the actual lab worksheet.
