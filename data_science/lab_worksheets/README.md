This is where I'll be placing my Jupyterlab/Google Colab worksheets. Most of my work is done on an Arch Linux machine except the final run before uploading, which I do on Windows 10 (though I will be changing this pipeline in the very near future.) 

#### IoT_device
Worksheets containing models I've built using [an IoT device dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fanbyprinciple/iot-device-identification). Consists of multiple parts due to the filesize (currently 2, most likely due to the size of the images I've used.) Apologies in advance if the notebook fails to load or doesn't download, future notebooks will be of a much smaller filesize.
